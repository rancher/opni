# Opni = AIOps for Kubernetes + Observability Tools

Opni currently features log anomaly detection for Kubernetes.

##### What does Opni give me?
* AI generated insights on your cluster's log messages
  * **Control Plane & etcd** insights
    * Pretrained models maintained by Rancher Labs
    * Only for RKE1, RKE2, k3s clusters
  * **Workload & application** insights
    * Automatically learns what steady-state is in your workloads & applications
    * For any Kubernetes cluster  
* Every log message sent to Opni will be marked as:
  * **Normal**
  * **Suspicious** - Operators may want to investigate
  * **Anomalous** - Operators definitely should investigate  
* Open Distro for Elasticsearch + Kibana 
  * Opni dashboard to consume log insights & explore logs 
  * Ability to setup & send alerts (slack/email/etc) based on Opni log insights

#### Try it out!
On a VM with 4 vCPUs & 16 GB RAM:
1. Create a RKE2 cluster with Opni installed
    ```
    curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/opni-docs/main/quickstart_files/install_opni.sh | sh -
    ```
2. Copy the NodePort from the script output
    * View insights at [IPV4_ADDRESS]:[NODE_PORT]

To inject an error into the demo cluster press 'Enter' when prompted by the script.  You can view this in the Opni Dashboard.

The default username and password is admin/admin You must be in the Global Tenant mode if you are not already. Click on Dashboard, Opni Logs Dashboard.
