# Opni - AIOPs for Kubernetes

Opni is a collection of AIOPs tools - it currently features log anomaly detection for Kubernetes. Future versions will introduce metric, event & trace anomaly detection, correlation analysis between all features, and remediation suggestions.

## Installing
Use a 1-command install: `opnictl` - A small tool to install the opni stack on Kubernetes cluster
```
opnictl install --kubeconfig <kubeconfig path>
```

### Options
The tool can be customized to specify different passwords and versions for the stack components:
```
# opnictl install --help
NAME:
   opnictl install - install opni stack

USAGE:
   opnictl install [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
   --kubeconfig value               [$KUBECONFIG]
   --minio-access-key value         [$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY]
   --minio-secret-key value         [$MINIO_SECRET_KEY]
   --minio-version value           (default: "4.0.8") [$MINIO_VERSION]
   --nats-version value            (default: "2.2.1") [$NATS_VERSION]
   --nats-password value            [$NATS_PASSWORD]
   --nats-replicas value           (default: 3) [$NATS_REPLICAS]
   --nats-max-payload value        (default: 10485760) [$NATS_MAX_PAYLOAD]
   --nvidia-version value          (default: "1.0.0-beta6") [$NVIDIA_VERSION]
   --elasticsearch-user value      (default: "admin") [$ES_USER]
   --elasticsearch-password value  (default: "admin") [$ES_PASSWORD]
   --traefik-version value         (default: "v9.18.3") [$TRAEFIK_VERSION]
```
If passwords are not specified for a specific component, a random generated password will be created for it.

For deleting the stack:
```
opnictl delete --kubeconfig <kubeconfig path> --all
```

#### What does Opni give me?
TODO: Add architecture markdown file
* Insights into logs from your cluster's workloads, control plane & etcd
* Opni insights dashboard to inspect logs
* Ability to send alerts (slack/email/etc) when anomaly threshold is breached

Every log message sent to Opni will be marked as either normal, suspicious, or anomalous.
If a lot of logs in a short period of time are marked as suspicious or anomalous it is probably worth investigating!
The anomaly threshold is a number that can tuned depending on your volume of logs and how frequently Opni is predicting anomalies.
____
#### Prerequisites
TODO Production
* At least two GPU nodes (K80 GPU or higher)
* One node with at least 4 CPUs
* At least three additional nodes each with at least 16 GB RAM and 40 GB of disk space.

Want to try Opni out on on a lightweight cluster? (it's a lightweight opni with only control plane logs anomaly detection)
TODO
____
#### How does it work?
TODO Move this to another markdown file
Ship logs over to your Opni cluster with [Rancher Logging](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/logging/v2.5/). That's it! Opni will continuously learn the nature of your logs and will update models automatically.
____
#### Upcoming features
- Prediction feedback - give feedback for incorrect predictions so the AI adapts better to your logs
- Control plane log anomaly detection for additional Kubernetes distributions besides RKE including K3S and EKS.

____
#### Ship Logs to Opni
Fetch the Opni service endpoint by running:
```
kubectl get svc traefik -n opni-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}'
```
* Your endpoint will look something like `xyz-xxxxxxxxx.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
____

### Development
TODO Add this to its own markdown file
Building

```
# make
```

All stack manifests are under `src/` directory, any added or changed yaml will be available as part of the stack after running Make


#### macOS

For building in MACOS you need to enable cross building by using the following command:

```
# CROSS=true make
```

Then the binary should be found under ./bin/opnictl-darwin

for running the tool, you can use the following command:

```
./bin/opnictl-darwin install --kubeconfig <kubeconfig path>
```

## Contributing
TODO Add this to its own markdown file
We use `pre-commit` for formatting auto-linting and checking import. Please refer to [installation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) to install the pre-commit or run `pip install pre-commit`. Then you can activate it for this repo. Once it's activated, it will lint and format the code when you make a git commit. It makes changes in place. If the code is modified during the reformatting, it needs to be staged manually.

```
# Install
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git commit hook to invoke automatically every time you do "git commit"
pre-commit install

# (Optional)Manually run against all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
